### What is Bariatric Surgery?

Bariatric surgery is a weight loss surgery designed to help individuals achieve significant and sustainable weight loss. It is typically performed for:

### How Bariatric Surgery Works

Bariatric surgery achieves weight loss through the following methods:
1. **Reducing the stomach size:**
   - The stomachâ€™s capacity is reduced from 1.5 liters to 150-200 ml.
   
2. **Rerouting the intestines:**
   - Prevents fat absorption through malabsorption.
   
3. **Hormonal changes:**
   - Alters hormones like ghrelin and leptin to suppress appetite and improve sugar regulation.

### Different Types of Bariatric Surgery

#### Commonly Performed Bariatric Surgeries:
- **Sleeve Gastrectomy:**
   - Removes 75% of the stomach, leaving a smaller, sleeve-shaped stomach.
   
- **Mini Gastric Bypass:**
   - Reduces stomach size and reroutes intestines for better weight loss and resolution of conditions like diabetes.
   
- **Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass:**
