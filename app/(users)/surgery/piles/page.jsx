    {
      question:"What are the potential complications associated with untreated Piles ?",
      answer:"Some of the potential complications include: Sometimes, blood clots form within a haemorrhoid, causing severe pain and swelling. This is known as thrombosed piles. Chronic blood loss from piles can lead to anaemia, characterized by fatigue and weakness.Strangulated haemorrhoids is an extremely painful condition which can occur due to loss of blood supply to piles mass. This condition requires urgent surgical intervention."
    },
    {
      question:"What is the best treatment for piles ?",
      answer:"The best treatment of piles depends upon the grade and stage of piles. While very early stages can be managed with the help of medicines and certain precautions, grades II and III are best managed with the help of laser surgeries.Grade IV haemorrhoids are usually treated by stapler surgery for piles. Open surgeries best manage complicated piles or excessively prolapsed piles."
    },
    {
      question:"What are the chances of recurrence after laser surgery of piles ?",
      answer:"The chances of recurrence after laser surgery for piles are usually 4-5%. However, recurrences can be prevented by using high-quality laser machines, properly indicating the procedure, and avoiding constipation after surgery."
    },
    {
      question:"Can piles be treated with medications ?",
      answer:"Piles can never be cured with medicines. However, medicines can delay the progression of disease or can help in providing symptomatic relief to the patients for some time. You must always seek the opinion of a specialist surgeon who can advise you on the best course of treatment."
    },
    {
      question:"What early surgical intervention for piles is better ?",
      answer:"Piles is a slowly progressive disease, and it is always better to treat piles when they are grade II or grade III. This is because these types of piles can be treated with laser, which is almost a painless procedure. If the piles progress to grade IV or develop complications, they may require open surgeries, which are quite painless during the initial days post-surgery."
    },
    {
      question:"How is the course of recovery after laser piles surgery ?",
      answer:"Laser surgery for piles is known for its quick recovery and minimal discomfort. Patients are typically discharged within 24 hours of the procedure and can resume normal activities within four to five days. Laser surgery doesn't require bed rest or post-operative dressings."
    },
    {
      question:"Is laser treatment safe for piles ?",
      answer:"Laser surgery is a highly safe procedure for the management of piles. The excellent quality laser machines are USFDA-approved and do not produce any side effects. However, it would be best if you considered the following facts before opting for the treatment: Experience and Expertise of surgeon Grade and stage of piles Quality of laser machines and fibres."
    },
    {
      question:"Does the quality of laser machines affect surgical outcomes ?",
      answer:" Does the quality of laser machines affect surgical outcomes? The quality of laser machines significantly affects surgical outcomes. Low-quality laser machines can lead to complications such as thermal burns. Even the likelihood of recurrence or piles returning is much higher than procedures performed with high-quality machines."

                  <p className='pt-2'>â†’ Laser surgery causes minimal discomfort post-surgery as there are no stitches or dressings involved.</p>
                  <p className='pt-2'>â†’ Laser surgery is almost bloodless as it seals the bleeding vessels efficiently.</p>
                  <p className='pt-2'>â†’ Recovery time is significantly shorter; patients can return to work within three to four days. The chances of infection are almost zero due to its minimally invasive nature.</p>
                  <p className='pt-2'>â†’ Laser surgery for piles is often performed on an outpatient basis, meaning patients can go home the same day.</p>

                <div className="mb-4">
                  <p className='pt-2'>â†’ Stapler surgery for piles, or Stapled Haemorrhoidopexy, is a modern and effective treatment option for patients suffering from prolapsed and symptomatic haemorrhoids.</p>
                  <p className='pt-2'>â†’ It is mainly indicated for Grade III and IV haemorrhoids, which involve a significant prolapse and are symptomatic.</p>
                  <p className='pt-2'>â†’  It is almost a painless procedure which doesnâ€™t involve any cutting of tissues and doesnâ€™t involve any dressings.</p>
                  <p className='pt-2'>â†’ The procedure involves using a disposable circular stapling device containing very tiny staples. </p>
                  <p className='pt-2'>â†’ The device is inserted into the anal canal and is used to excise a circumferential ring of excess haemorrhoid tissue.</p>
                  <p className='pt-2 ml-4'> The tiny staples seal the bleeding vessels and reposition the haemorrhoids to their standard anatomical location.</p>
                  <p className='pt-2'>â†’ The surgery is associated with minimal pain and bleeding, and patients can expect a return to normal activities within a couple of days.</p>

                <div className="mb-4">
                  <p className='pt-2'>â†’  The Doppler-Guided Hemorrhoidal Artery Ligation (DGHAL) and Recto Anal Repair is an advanced and minimally invasive procedure for treating piles.</p>
                  <p className='pt-2'>â†’ This cutting-edge, painless technique is mainly indicated for patients having bleeding as the primary symptom or having recurrent piles.</p>
                  <p className='pt-2'>â†’ DGHAL involves using a Doppler probe to locate the blood vessels supplying the haemorrhoids accurately. Once identified, a suture ties off these blood vessels, sealing the bleeding vessels. </p>
                  <p className='pt-2 ml-4'> Additionally, a running suture is employed to pull the prolapsed piles back to their normal position.</p>
                  <p className='pt-2'>â†’ DGHAL is rated as an extremely safe procedure with minimal chances of any complications. The procedure is associated with quick recovery and early return to work.</p>
