      question:"Can I live a normal life after gallbladder removal surgery?",
      answer:"You can live a normal life without gallbladder. The gallbladder is only a storehouse. Bile production from the liver will never stop and the bile produced by liver empties directly into small intestine. Post surgery, you can resume a normal diet with or without a few modifications. There are no long-term consequences of the removal of a gallbladder on digestion or overall health."
    },
    {
      question:"Are there any medicines that can help in dissolving gallstones?",
      answer:"Certain medicines can help dissolve gallstones, but the results are not promising. Only tiny cholesterol stones can dissolve if medicines are taken for a long time. The chances of reformation of gallstones are very high once these medicines are stopped. You must contact a gallstone specialist to determine if medication therapy is suitable for your specific situation."
    },
    {
      question:"Should I go for gallbladder surgery for asymptomatic gallstones?",
      answer:"This being a very important decision should be considered at the hands of gallstone specialist. Asymptomatic gallstones can, of course and most likely will at some time in the future, will start developing complications. The gallbladder stone specialist surgeon will tell you about the risks and benefits of your case. And naturally, everyone's story is different; what works for one individual will not work the same way for another."
    },
    {
      question:"Can gallbladder stones be cancerous?",
      answer:"The association between gallstones and risk for developing cancer of the gallbladder, while not seen in most populations on a worldwide basis. Long-standing inflammation in the gallbladder from having stones can lead to cancerous changes over time."
    },
    {
      question:"What are gallbladder polyps, and should I remove them?",
      answer:"The decision to remove gallbladder polyps depends on several factors, including the size of the polyps, the presence of symptoms, risk factors for gallbladder cancer, and individual preferences. You must contact the best gallbladder stone specialist to discuss the risks and benefits of surgery."
    },
    {
      question:"What is the role of apple cider in dissolving gallstones?",
      answer:"It is not well supported by scientific data that apple cider helps with dissolution of gallstones. The majority of the claims have been derived from traditional use rather than any form of scientific studies. Since the main component of apple cider vinegar is an acetic acid, not enough evidence exists that even a small amount could dissolve gallstones."
    },
    {
      question:"How can I prevent formation of gallstones?",
      answer:"However, most gallstones can be prevented with a healthy lifestyle that includes dietary modification and sometimes medications plus regular exercise. In general, diets low in fat and high in fiber may reduced risk. Avoid quick weight gain or loss, as it disrupts cholesterol metabolism and favors the formation of gallstones."
    },
    {
      question:"can gall bladder and hernia surgery be performed together?",
      answer:"So it is common to do gallbladder surgery and hernia repair the same time. It is especially therapeutic in cases of combined surgery and the patient under goes best if both are indicated.<br/> Still, the choice relies on how complicated are the two surgeries and experience and expertise of the surgeon. Your surgeon is the best person to decide if it is safe to perform both the surgeries simultaneously."

              <p className="pt-2">
                The gallbladder is a tiny pear-shaped organ located just below the liver, situated on the right upper side of the abdomen.  <br />The liver produces a yellow-coloured fluid known as bile, which flows into the intestine to aid in digesting food, especially fatty meals.
